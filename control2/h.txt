A dog is a man's best friend

A drowning man will clutch at a straw

A fish always rots from the head down

A fool and his money are soon parted

A friend in need is a friend indeed

A golden key can open any door

A good beginning makes a good ending

A good man is hard to find

A house divided against itself cannot stand

A person is known by the company he keeps

A house is not a home

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step

A leopard cannot change its spots

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing

A little learning is a dangerous thing

A little of what you fancy does you good

A man is known by his friends

A man who is his own lawyer has a fool for his client

A miss is as good as a mile

A new broom sweeps clean

A nod's as good as a wink to a blind horse

A penny saved is a penny earned

A picture paints a thousand words

A place for everything and everything in its place

A poor workman always blames his tools

A person is known by the company he keeps

A problem shared is a problem halved

A prophet is not recognized in his own land

A rising tide lifts all boats

A rolling stone gathers no moss

A soft answer turneth away wrath

A stitch in time saves nine

A thing of beauty is a joy forever

A trouble shared is a trouble halved

A volunteer is worth twenty pressed men

A watched pot never boils

A woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke

A woman's place is in the home

A woman's work is never done

A word to the wise is enough

Absence makes the heart grow fonder

Absolute power corrupts absolutely

Accidents will happen (in the best-regulated families).

Actions speak louder than words

Adversity makes strange bedfellows

After a storm comes a calm

All good things come to he who waits

All good things must come to an end

All is grist that comes to the mill

All publicity is good publicity

All roads lead to Rome

All that glisters is not gold

All that glitters is not gold

All the world loves a lover

All things come to those that wait

All things must pass

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy

All you need is love

All's fair in love and war

All's for the best in the best of all possible worlds

All's well that ends well

A miss is as good as a mile

An apple a day keeps the doctor away

An army marches on its stomach

An Englishman's home is his castle

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure

Another day, another dollar

Any port in a storm

Appearances can be deceptive

April is the cruellest month

April showers bring forth May flowers

As thick as thieves

As you make your bed, so you must lie upon it

As you sow so shall you reap

Ashes to ashes dust to dust

Ask a silly question and you'll get a silly answer

Ask no questions and hear no lies

Attack is the best form of defence

Bad money drives out good

Bad news travels fast

Barking dogs seldom bite

Be careful what you wish for

Beat swords into ploughshares

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

Beauty is only skin deep

Beggars should not be choosers

Behind every great man there's a great woman

Better late than never

Better safe than sorry

Better the Devil you know than the Devil you don't

Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all

Better to light a candle than to curse the darkness

Beware of Greeks bearing gifts

Beware the Ides of March

Big fish eat little fish

Birds of a feather flock together

Blessed are the peacemakers

Blood is thicker than water

Blue are the hills that are far away

Boys will be boys

Brevity is the soul of wit

Business before pleasure

Caesar's wife must be above suspicion

Carpe diem (Pluck the day; Seize the day)

Charity begins at home

Charity covers a multitude of sins

Cheaters never win and winners never cheat

Cheats never prosper

Children and fools tell the truth

Children should be seen and not heard

Christmas comes but once a year

Cleanliness is next to godliness

Clothes maketh the man

Cold hands, warm heart

Comparisons are odious

Count your blessings

Cowards may die many times before their death

Crime doesn't pay

Cut your coat to suit your cloth

Dead men tell no tales

Devil take the hindmost

Different strokes for different folks

Discretion is the better part of valour

Distance lends enchantment to the view

Do as I say, not as I do

Do as you would be done by

Do unto others as you would have them do to you

Don't bite the hand that feeds you

Don't burn your bridges behind you

Don't cast your pearls before swine

Don't change horses in midstream

Don't count your chickens before they are hatched

Don't cross the bridge till you come to it

Don't cut off your nose to spite your face

Don't get mad, get even

Don't keep a dog and bark yourself

Don't leave your manners on the doorstep

Don't let the bastards grind you down

Don't let the cat out of the bag

Don't let the grass grow under your feet
